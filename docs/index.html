        <img class="responsive-img" src="img/banner.png">

        <h5>Project goal</h5>
        <p>
            The goal of the project is to deploy soil moisture testbeds across multiple states to evaluate, calibrate, and disseminate existing and emerging research-grade and consumer-grade in-situ sensing technologies.
        </p>

        <h5>Team</h5>
        <p>
            This is a collaborative project among four U.S. institutions:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    - Andres Patrignani and Nathaniel Parker (Postdoc), Soil Water Processes, Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Briana Wyatt, Soil Physics, Department of Soil and Crop Sciences, Texas A&M
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Michael Cosh, Hydrology and Remote Sensing Laboratory, USDA-ARS, Beltsville, MD
                </li>
                <li>
                    - Tyson Ochsner and Jerry Brown (PhD student), Soil Physics, Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, Oklahoma State University
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h5>Support</h5>
        <p>
            The project is supported by the United State Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) through award #NR213A750025C007 and the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) through multi-state project W4188.
