# Multistate In-situ Sensor Testbed (MIST)

The goal of the project is to deploy soil moisture testbeds across multiple states to evaluate, calibrate, and disseminate existing and emerging research-grade and consumer-grade in-situ sensing technologies.

This is a collaborative project among four U.S. institutions:

- Andres Patrignani and Nathaniel Parker (Postdoc), Soil Water Processes, Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University
- Briana Wyatt, Soil Physics, Department of Soil and Crop Sciences, Texas A&M
- Michael Cosh, Hydrology and Remote Sensing Laboratory, USDA-ARS, Beltsville, MD
- Tyson Ochsner and Jerry Brown (PhD student), Soil Physics, Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, Oklahoma State University

The project is supported by the United State Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) through award #NR213A750025C007 and the USDA National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA) through multi-state project W4188.
