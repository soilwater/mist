# Multistate In-situ Sensor Testbed (MIST)

The goal of the project is to deploy soil moisture testbeds across multiple states to evaluate, calibrate, and disseminate existing and emerging research-grade and consumer-grade in-situ sensing technologies.

This is a collaborative project among four U.S. institutions:

Andres Patrignani, Soil Water Processes, Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University
Briana Wyatt, Soil Physics, Department of Soil and Crop Sciences, Texas A&M
Michael Cosh, Hydrology and Remote Sensing Laboratory, USDA-ARS, Beltsville, MD
Tyson Ochsner, Soil Physics, Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, Oklahoma State University
